# TriggersToGLTF
Converts an extracted triggers resource from Burnout Paradise to a GLTF asset. All retail game versions and platforms are supported.

At the moment, there is a [major issue](https://github.com/burninrubber0/TriggersToGLTF/issues/1). Until it is fixed, this tool is more of a gimmick than anything. If you are a developer, you will need to fix this before attempting to export back to a triggers resource.

```
Usage: TriggersToGLTF [-p PLATFORM] <input triggers> <output glTF>

Options:
 -p   File platform. PS3, X360, PC, PS4, or NX. Default: PC
```
